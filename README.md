I graduated from BYU â€” Idaho in April 2023. I earned a Bachelor's of Science, majoring in Web Design and Development. I love to work on full-stack project and I have worked primarily in Angular and Node.js. Visit my portfolio site [aaronhathaway.com](https://aaronhathaway.com) to see some projects I'm currently working on. I have developed and designed website, web apps, and mobile apps.

These are the skills I've been working. I make it a point to revisit and update them from the foundational ones such as HTML and CSS all the way to more advanced ones like rxJS. I also enjoy helping small businesses succeed by utilizing my data science skills and SEO.
